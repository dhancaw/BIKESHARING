## Business Problem

**Capital Bikeshare** seeks to optimize bike availability to meet demand while minimizing operational costs. The challenge is to predict the number of bikes required in different conditions and situations.

## Data Overview

- Dataset: Bike rental data (2011-2012) from **Capital Bikeshare**.
- Attributes: Date, humidity, weather situation, holiday status, season, temperature, hour, casual users, registered users, total rentals.

## Data Preprocessing

Cleaned and prepared data for analysis:
- Adjusted column names for clarity.
- Handled data types.
- Checked for missing values and duplicates.
- Removed irrelevant features.
- Explored data correlations and identified outliers.

## Modeling

- Developed a predictive model using XGBoost.
- Evaluated the model using benchmark comparisons.
- Predicted bike demand on the test set.

## Conclusion

This project successfully addressed **Capital Bikeshare's** challenge by building an accurate predictive model. The XGBoost model enables informed decisions regarding bike allocation for various conditions, maintaining cost efficiency while satisfying customer demand.
